# A script that posts to [r/Traditional_Haiku](https://www.reddit.com/r/Traditional_Haiku/)

The main script is located in `bashobot.py`. To execute from terminal I add `alias bashobot="/Users/steve/Documents/code/bashobot/bashobot.py"` to my `.`.zshrc`

Followed [this](https://www.jcchouinard.com/reddit-api/) tutorial. 

As it is, the script only allows you to post one haiku per day.
