    "Standing still at dusk\nlisten...  In far\ndistances\nThe song of froglings!",
    "My two plum trees are\nso gracious... \nsee, they flower\nOne now, one later",
    "The laden wagon runs\nbumbling and creaking\ndown the road... \nThree peonies tremble",
    "Lightning flash, crash... \nwaiting in the\nbamboo grove\nSee three dew-drops fall",
    "Afternoon shower... \nwalking and talking\nin the street:\nUmbrella and raincoat!",
    "Sadness at twilight... \nvillain! I have\nlet my hand\nCut that peony",
    "In dim dusk and scent\na witness\nnow half hidden... \nEvenfall orchid",
    "Voices of two bells\nthat speak from\ntwilight temples... \nAh! Cool dialogue",
    "Deep in dark forest\na woodcutter's\ndull axe talking... \nAnd a woodcutter",
    "Butterfly asleep\nfolded soft on\ntemple bell... \nThen bronze gong rang!",
    "See the morning breeze\nruffling his so\nsilky hair... \nCool caterpillar",
    "A camellia\ndropped down into\nstill waters\nOf a deep dark well",
    "In the holy dusk\nnightingales begin\ntheir psalm... \nGood! The dinner-gong!",
    "A short summer night... \nbut in this solemn\ndarkness\nOne peony bloomed",
    "Pebbles shining clear,\nand clear\nsix silent fishes... \nDeep autumn water",
    "A bright autumn moon... \nin the shadow of\neach grass\nAn insect chirping",
    "White chrysanthemum... \nbefore that\nperfect flower\nScissors hesitate",
    "At furue in rain\ngray water and\ngrey sand... \nPicture without lines",
    "The old fisherman\nunalterably\nintent... \nCold evening rain",
    "Rainy-month, dripping\non and on\nas I lie abed... \nAh, old man's memories!",
    "Slanting lines of rain... \non the dusty\nsamisen\nA mouse is trotting",
    "Old weary willows... \nI thought how long\nthe road would be\nWhen you went away"
